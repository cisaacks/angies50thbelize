# Angie’s 50th — Belize (v17: videos added)

This version is identical to your previous live site, except:
- A **Belize Videos** section was added below **Golf Cart Rentals** and above **Optional Tour**.
- Five YouTube videos are embedded and playable on the page.

## How to Deploy (GitHub + Vercel)
1. Open your GitHub repo for the site.
2. Click **Add file → Upload files**, drag **index.html** here (replace existing).
3. Commit. Vercel auto‑redeploys.
4. Hard refresh your live site: **Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+R**.

Everything else (RSVP → Google Sheet, trip details sheet, gallery) works exactly as before.
